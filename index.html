<p>Our <a href="http://www.hivechicagobuzz.org/">Hive Chicago Buzz</a> session focused on creating key messages for parents. We started with <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/iridescentlearning.org/document/d/1sYW0FJRSaCHZIw_LxrrRdzUOX7semBq27ppPBuh5I7M/edit">current messaging</a> on Connceted Learning and digital badges from various sources and pulled out the ideas we thought it would be most important for bringing parents on board. Our next step is to get feedback on these messages from parent groups, with the help of Chicago City of Learning. If you have comments or recommendations, you add ideas to our <a href="http://www.civicartworks.com/projects/hive-chicago-buzz-engaging-and-educating-chicago-parents">Civic Artworks page</a>! </p>

<ul>
<li>Our city is full of free opportunities for your child to explore their interests, find their passions, and become lifelong learners </li>
<li>Whether your child is interested in online learning or joining a program with others, these programs are easily accessible and available in your community </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="why-does-it-matter" class="anchor" href="#why-does-it-matter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHY DOES IT MATTER?</h3>

<ul>
<li>No one institution (schools, churches, museums, families) can prepare young people for their futures</li>
<li>When kids explore their interests, they become lifelong learners</li>
<li>Chicago City of Learning bridges young people’s interests and passions of all ages with learning opportunities throughout the year</li>
<li>Chicago City of Learning sustains your child’s learning over the summer</li>
<li>Families are a critical steward in supporting young people of all ages in exploring interests, developing their talents, discovering their passions, and charting their pathways into the future </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="learning-happens-everywhere" class="anchor" href="#learning-happens-everywhere" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LEARNING HAPPENS EVERYWHERE</h3>

<ul>
<li>Learning doesn’t start and stop at the school door </li>
<li>Did you know that only 20% of a child’s waking hours are spent in school each year? </li>
<li>Your child is learning at home, at school, and in the community</li>
<li>You can help your child connect what they learn in school with their interests<br>
</li>
<li>When you ask your child “what did you learn today?” it can be about more than what happened in the classroom </li>
<li>Everyday interactions (at the grocery store, etc.) can be learning opportunities</li>
<li>You’re a teacher, the city is your classroom -- use spring break to keep the learning going! </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="learning-is-driven-by-interests" class="anchor" href="#learning-is-driven-by-interests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LEARNING IS DRIVEN BY INTERESTS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Find learning opportunities based on your child’s interest, passion, and curiosity </li>
<li>Things your child loves to do, whatever they are, count as learning! (need examples)</li>
<li>Encouraging your child to find opportunities they’re interested in builds independence </li>
<li>Equip yourself with resources to help your child pursue their passion </li>
</ul>

<li>Digital badges can unlock opportunities and special rewards<br>
</li>
<li>Digital badges can lead your child to related learning experiences and opportunities </li>
<li>Digital badges are like a digital resume </li>
<li>Digital badges recognize your child’s achievements </li>
